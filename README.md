<h1>Resolving Tickets in osTicket</h1>
In this lab I go through the lifecycle of a ticket from intake to resolution within the open-source help desk ticketing system osTicket.<br />

<h2>Lifecycle Stages</h2>

To create tickets, users must access the ticket portal and log in if required. Within the portal, users can submit ticket requests and describe their IT-related issues. For this lab, I created three tickets representing various problems that might occur in a real environment. Tickets are generated using a Help Topic, a brief summary of the issue, and detailed descriptions written in the style of an email.

From an admin's perspective, ticket requests appear in their panel once submitted. Admins can reassign tickets to an agent or the appropriate team and determine the issue's severity level to ensure it is addressed within the SLA. In this scenario, Jane reviewed the ticket, assigned it to the System Administrators, and set the severity level to Emergency.

Resolving tickets requires strong communication, both with the team and the affected users. Tickets vary in issues and are assigned to the appropriate individuals. For example, one ticket was assigned to John by Jane, while Jane independently managed another ticket. Proper documentation is essential for a successful environment, as well-documented tickets can serve as references for resolving similar issues in the future.

<h2>Lessons Learned</h2>

The process for managing tickets can vary depending on the work environment. There may be quotas for the number of tickets that need to be resolved within a specific time frame, and certain tickets may require prioritization based on their urgency. By building osTicket from scratch, I gained a solid understanding of how ticketing systems function in an IT role.
